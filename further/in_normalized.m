%  This scrip is the input file that only takes normalized quantities
%  All input files should be named by in_*.m !
% The time-advanced quantities are (always labels the lastest of them)
%  p: ion temperature
%  pe: electron temperature
%  den: density (quasi-neutrality)
%  vi: ion parallel velocity
%  w: vorticity
%  in practice, we advance the logorithm of p, pe and den, so that they
%  are more accurately solved when they are small
% these quantities are appended by '_aux' if they are auxiliary 
% quantities for our time-advancing scheme, e.g.
%  w_aux: auxiliary ion vorticity
% other quantities are (always labels the latest of them)
%  jz: parallel current
%  ve: electron paralle velocity
%  Te: electron Temperature
%  phi: electrostatic potential
%  vEx: EXB velocity in r direction
%  vEy: EXB velocity in \theta direction
%  all these 11 quantities are saved in dat****.mat normalized
